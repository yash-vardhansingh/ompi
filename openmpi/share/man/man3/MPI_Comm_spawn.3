.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP tries to start \fImaxprocs\fP identical copies of the MPI
program specified by \fIcommand\fP, establishing communication with them and
returning an intercommunicator. The spawned processes are referred to as
children. The children have their own MPI_COMM_WORLD, which is separate
from that of the parents. \fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP is collective over \fIcomm\fP, and
also may not return until \fI\%MPI_Init\fP has been called in the children.
Similarly, \fI\%MPI_Init\fP in the children may not return until all parents
have called \fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP\&. In this sense, \fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP in the parents
and \fI\%MPI_Init\fP in the children form a collective operation over the union
of parent and child processes. The intercommunicator returned by
\fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP contains the parent processes in the local group and the
child processes in the remote group. The ordering of processes in the
local and remote groups is the same as the as the ordering of the group
of the \fIcomm\fP in the parents and of MPI_COMM_WORLD of the children,
respectively. This intercommunicator can be obtained in the children
through the function \fI\%MPI_Comm_get_parent\fP\&.
.sp
The MPI standard allows an implementation to use the MPI_UNIVERSE_SIZE
attribute of MPI_COMM_WORLD to specify the number of processes that will
be active in a program. Although this implementation of the MPI standard
defines MPI_UNIVERSE_SIZE, it does not allow the user to set its value.
If you try to set the value of MPI_UNIVERSE_SIZE, you will get an error
message.
.sp
The \fIcommand\fP Argument
.sp
The \fIcommand\fP argument is a string containing the name of a program to
be spawned. The string is null\-terminated in C. In Fortran, leading and
trailing spaces are stripped. MPI looks for the file first in the
working directory of the spawning process.
.sp
The \fIargv\fP Argument
.sp
\fIargv\fP is an array of strings containing arguments that are passed to
the program. The first element of \fIargv\fP is the first argument passed to
\fIcommand\fP, not, as is conventional in some contexts, the command itself.
The argument list is terminated by NULL in C and an empty string in
Fortran (note that it is the MPI application’s responsibility to ensure
that the last entry of the \fIargv\fP array is an empty string; the compiler
will not automatically insert it). In Fortran, leading and trailing
spaces are always stripped, so that a string consisting of all spaces is
considered an empty string. The constant MPI_ARGV_NULL may be used in C
and Fortran to indicate an empty argument list. In C, this constant is
the same as NULL.
.sp
In C, the \fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP argument \fIargv\fP differs from the \fIargv\fP
argument of \fImain\fP in two respects. First, it is shifted by one element.
Specifically, \fIargv\fP[0] of \fImain\fP contains the name of the program
(given by \fIcommand\fP). \fIargv\fP[1] of \fImain\fP corresponds to \fIargv\fP[0]
in \fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP, \fIargv\fP[2] of \fImain\fP to \fIargv\fP[1] of
\fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP, and so on. Second, \fIargv\fP of \fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP must be
null\-terminated, so that its length can be determined. Passing an \fIargv\fP
of MPI_ARGV_NULL to \fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP results in \fImain\fP receiving \fIargc\fP of
1 and an \fIargv\fP whose element 0 is the name of the program.
.sp
The \fImaxprocs\fP Argument
.sp
Open MPI tries to spawn \fImaxprocs\fP processes. If it is unable to spawn
\fImaxprocs\fP processes, it raises an error of class MPI_ERR_SPAWN. If MPI
is able to spawn the specified number of processes, \fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP
returns successfully and the number of spawned processes, \fIm\fP, is given
by the size of the remote group of \fIintercomm\fP\&.
.sp
A spawn call with the default behavior is called hard. A spawn call for
which fewer than \fImaxprocs\fP processes may be returned is called soft.
.sp
The \fIinfo\fP Argument
.sp
The \fIinfo\fP argument is an opaque handle of type MPI_Info in C and
INTEGER in Fortran. It is a container for a number of user\-specified
(\fIkey,value\fP) pairs. \fIkey\fP and \fIvalue\fP are strings (null\-terminated
\fBchar *\fP in C, \fBcharacter*(*)\fP in Fortran). Routines to create and
manipulate the \fIinfo\fP argument are described in Section 4.10 of the
MPI\-2 standard.
.sp
For the SPAWN calls, \fIinfo\fP provides additional,
implementation\-dependent instructions to MPI and the runtime system on
how to start processes. An application may pass MPI_INFO_NULL in C or
Fortran. Portable programs not requiring detailed control over process
locations should use MPI_INFO_NULL.
.sp
The following keys for \fIinfo\fP are recognized in Open MPI. (The reserved
values mentioned in Section 5.3.4 of the MPI\-2 standard are not
implemented.)

                                spawned.  See the orte_host man
                                page for an explanation of how this

wdir                   char *   Directory where the executable is
                                located. If files are to be
                                pre\-positioned, then this location is
                                the desired working directory at time
                                of execution \- if not specified, then

                                ompi_preload_files_dest_dir.
ompi_prefix            char *   Same as the \-\-prefix command line
                                argument to mpirun.
ompi_preload_binary    bool     If set to true, pre\-position the

                                host. A destination directory must
                                also be provided.
ompi_preload_files     char *   A comma\-separated list of files that
                                are to be pre\-positioned in addition
                                to the executable.  Note that this
                                option does not depend upon
                                ompi_preload_binary \- files can
                                be moved to the target even if an
                                executable is not moved.
ompi_stdin_target      char *   Comma\-delimited list of ranks to
                                receive stdin when forwarded.

                                application; the returned communicator
                                will be MPI_COMM_NULL. Failure to set
                                this flag when launching a non\-MPI
                                application will cause both the child
                                and parent jobs to "hang".
ompi_param             char *   Pass an OMPI MCA parameter to the
                                child job.  If that parameter already
                                exists in the environment, the value
                                will be overwritten by the provided

\fIbool\fP info keys are actually strings but are evaluated as follows: if
the string value is a number, it is converted to an integer and cast to
a boolean (meaning that zero integers are false and non\-zero values are
true). If the string value is (case\-insensitive) “yes” or “true”, the
boolean is true. If the string value is (case\-insensitive) “no” or
“false”, the boolean is false. All other string values are unrecognized,
and therefore false.
.sp
The \fIroot\fP Argument
.sp
All arguments before the \fIroot\fP argument are examined only on the
process whose rank in \fIcomm\fP is equal to \fIroot\fP\&. The value of these
arguments on other processes is ignored.
.sp
The \fIarray_of_errcodes\fP Argument
.sp
The \fIarray_of_errcodes\fP is an array of length \fImaxprocs\fP in which MPI
reports the status of the processes that MPI was requested to start. If
all \fImaxprocs\fP processes were spawned, \fIarray_of_errcodes\fP is filled in
with the value MPI_SUCCESS. If anyof the processes are \fInot\fP spawned,
\fIarray_of_errcodes\fP is filled in with the value MPI_ERR_SPAWN. In C or
Fortran, an application may pass MPI_ERRCODES_IGNORE if it is not
interested in the error codes.
.SH NOTES
.sp
Completion of \fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP in the parent does not necessarily mean
that \fI\%MPI_Init\fP has been called in the children (although the returned
intercommunicator can be used immediately).
.SH ERRORS
.sp
Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the return result
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.
.sp
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler associated
with the communication object (e.g., communicator, window, file) is called.
If no communication object is associated with the MPI call, then the call is
considered attached to MPI_COMM_SELF and will call the associated MPI error
handler. When MPI_COMM_SELF is not initialized (i.e., before
\fI\%MPI_Init\fP/\fI\%MPI_Init_thread\fP, after \fI\%MPI_Finalize\fP, or when using the Sessions
Model exclusively) the error raises the initial error handler. The initial
error handler can be changed by calling \fI\%MPI_Comm_set_errhandler\fP on
MPI_COMM_SELF when using the World model, or the mpi_initial_errhandler CLI
argument to mpiexec or info key to \fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP/\fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple\fP\&.
If no other appropriate error handler has been set, then the MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
error handler is called for MPI I/O functions and the MPI_ERRORS_ABORT error
handler is called for all other MPI functions.
.sp
Open MPI includes three predefined error handlers that can be used:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL\fP
Causes the program to abort all connected MPI processes.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMPI_ERRORS_ABORT\fP
An error handler that can be invoked on a communicator,
window, file, or session. When called on a communicator, it
acts as if \fI\%MPI_Abort\fP was called on that communicator. If
called on a window or file, acts as if \fI\%MPI_Abort\fP was called
on a communicator containing the group of processes in the
corresponding window or file. If called on a session,
aborts only the local process.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMPI_ERRORS_RETURN\fP
Returns an error code to the application.
.UNINDENT
.sp
MPI applications can also implement their own error handlers by calling:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%MPI_Comm_create_errhandler\fP then \fI\%MPI_Comm_set_errhandler\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%MPI_File_create_errhandler\fP then \fI\%MPI_File_set_errhandler\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%MPI_Session_create_errhandler\fP then \fI\%MPI_Session_set_errhandler\fP or at \fI\%MPI_Session_init\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%MPI_Win_create_errhandler\fP then \fI\%MPI_Win_set_errhandler\fP
.UNINDENT

Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past
an error.
