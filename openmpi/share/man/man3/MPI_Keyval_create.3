.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Note that use of this routine is \fIdeprecated\fP as of MPI\-2. Please use
\fI\%MPI_Comm_create_keyval\fP instead.
.sp
Generates a new attribute key. Keys are locally unique in a process and
opaque to the user, though they are explicitly stored in integers. Once
allocated, the key value can be used to associate attributes and access
them on any locally defined communicator.
.sp
The copy_fn function is invoked when a communicator is duplicated by
\fI\%MPI_Comm_dup\fP\&. copy_fn should be of type MPI_Copy_function, which is
defined as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
typedef int MPI_Copy_function(MPI_Comm oldcomm, int keyval,
                              void *extra_state, void *attribute_val_in,
                              void *attribute_val_out, int *flag)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A Fortran declaration for such a function is as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
SUBROUTINE COPY_FUNCTION(OLDCOMM, KEYVAL, EXTRA_STATE, ATTRIBUTE_VAL_IN,
            ATTRIBUTE_VAL_OUT, FLAG, IERR)
INTEGER OLDCOMM, KEYVAL, EXTRA_STATE,
ATTRIBUTE_VAL_IN, ATTRIBUTE_VAL_OUT, IERR
LOGICAL FLAG
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The copy callback function is invoked for each key value in oldcomm in
arbitrary order. Each call to the copy callback is made with a key value
and its corresponding attribute. If it returns flag = 0, then the
attribute is deleted in the duplicated communicator. Otherwise ( flag =
1), the new attribute value is set to the value returned in
attribute_val_out. The function returns MPI_SUCCESS on success and an
error code on failure (in which case \fI\%MPI_Comm_dup\fP will fail).
.sp
copy_fn may be specified as MPI_NULL_COPY_FN or MPI_DUP_FN from either C
or Fortran; MPI_NULL_COPY_FN is a function that does nothing other than
return flag = 0, and MPI_SUCCESS. MPI_DUP_FN is a simple\-minded copy
function that sets flag = 1, returns the value of attribute_val_in in
attribute_val_out, and returns MPI_SUCCESS.
.SH NOTES
.sp
Key values are global (available for any and all communicators).
.sp
There are subtle differences between C and Fortran that require that the
copy_fn be written in the same language that \fI\%MPI_Keyval_create\fP is called
from. This should not be a problem for most users; only programmers
using both Fortran and C in the same program need to be sure that they
follow this rule.
.sp
Even though both formal arguments attribute_val_in and attribute_val_out
are of type void*, their usage differs. The C copy function is passed by
MPI in attribute_val_in the value of the attribute, and in
attribute_val_out the address of the attribute, so as to allow the
function to return the (new) attribute value. The use of type \fBvoid *\fP for
both is to avoid messy type casts.
.sp
A valid copy function is one that completely duplicates the information
by making a full duplicate copy of the data structures implied by an
attribute; another might just make another reference to that data
structure, while using a reference\-count mechanism. Other types of
attributes might not copy at all (they might be specific to oldcomm
only).
.sp
Analogous to copy_fn is a callback deletion function, defined as
follows. The delete_fn function is invoked when a communicator is
deleted by \fI\%MPI_Comm_free\fP or when a call is made explicitly to
\fI\%MPI_Attr_delete\fP\&. delete_fn should be of type MPI_Delete_function, which
is defined as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
typedef int MPI_Delete_function(MPI_Comm comm, int keyval,
    void *attribute_val, void *extra_state);
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A Fortran declaration for such a function is as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
SUBROUTINE DELETE_FUNCTION(COMM, KEYVAL,ATTRIBUTE_VAL, EXTRA_STATE, IERR)
    INTEGER COMM, KEYVAL, ATTRIBUTE_VAL, EXTRA_STATE, IERR
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This function is called by \fI\%MPI_Comm_free\fP, \fI\%MPI_Attr_delete\fP, and
\fI\%MPI_Attr_put\fP to do whatever is needed to remove an attribute. The
function returns MPI_SUCCESS on success and an error code on failure (in
which case \fI\%MPI_Comm_free\fP will fail).
.sp
delete_fn may be specified as MPI_NULL_DELETE_FN from either C or
FORTRAN; MPI_NULL_DELETE_FN is a function that does nothing, other than
returning MPI_SUCCESS.
.sp
The special key value MPI_KEYVAL_INVALID is never returned by
\fI\%MPI_Keyval_create\fP\&. Therefore, it can be used for static initialization
of key values.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as the return result
of the function and Fortran routines in the last argument.
.sp
Before the error value is returned, the current MPI error handler associated
with the communication object (e.g., communicator, window, file) is called.
If no communication object is associated with the MPI call, then the call is
considered attached to MPI_COMM_SELF and will call the associated MPI error
handler. When MPI_COMM_SELF is not initialized (i.e., before
\fI\%MPI_Init\fP/\fI\%MPI_Init_thread\fP, after \fI\%MPI_Finalize\fP, or when using the Sessions
Model exclusively) the error raises the initial error handler. The initial
error handler can be changed by calling \fI\%MPI_Comm_set_errhandler\fP on
MPI_COMM_SELF when using the World model, or the mpi_initial_errhandler CLI
argument to mpiexec or info key to \fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn\fP/\fI\%MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple\fP\&.
If no other appropriate error handler has been set, then the MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
error handler is called for MPI I/O functions and the MPI_ERRORS_ABORT error
handler is called for all other MPI functions.
.sp
Open MPI includes three predefined error handlers that can be used:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL\fP
Causes the program to abort all connected MPI processes.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMPI_ERRORS_ABORT\fP
An error handler that can be invoked on a communicator,
window, file, or session. When called on a communicator, it
acts as if \fI\%MPI_Abort\fP was called on that communicator. If
called on a window or file, acts as if \fI\%MPI_Abort\fP was called
on a communicator containing the group of processes in the
corresponding window or file. If called on a session,
aborts only the local process.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBMPI_ERRORS_RETURN\fP
Returns an error code to the application.
.UNINDENT
.sp
MPI applications can also implement their own error handlers by calling:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%MPI_Comm_create_errhandler\fP then \fI\%MPI_Comm_set_errhandler\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%MPI_File_create_errhandler\fP then \fI\%MPI_File_set_errhandler\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%MPI_Session_create_errhandler\fP then \fI\%MPI_Session_set_errhandler\fP or at \fI\%MPI_Session_init\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%MPI_Win_create_errhandler\fP then \fI\%MPI_Win_set_errhandler\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past
an error.
