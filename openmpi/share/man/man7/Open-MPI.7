Open MPI \- General information
.SH OPEN MPI
.sp
Open MPI is an open source implementation of MPI (message\-passing
interface), the industry\-standard specification for writing
message\-passing programs. Message passing is a programming model that
gives the programmer explicit control over interprocess communication.
.sp
The MPI specification was developed by the MPI Forum, a group of
software developers, computer vendors, academics, and computer\-science
researchers whose goal was to develop a standard for writing
message\-passing programs that would be efficient, flexible, and
portable.
.sp
The outcome, known as the MPI Standard, was first published in 1993; its
most recent version (MPI\-4.0) was published in June 2021. Open MPI
includes all MPI 3.1\-compliant routines.
.sp
For more information about Open MPI, see \fI\%https://www.open\-mpi.org\fP\&.
.sp
The MPI standards are available at \fI\%https://www.mpi\-forum.org\fP\&.
.SH MAN PAGE SYNTAX
.sp
Man pages for Open MPI and Open MPI I/O routines are named according to
C syntax, that is, they begin with the prefix \fBMPI_\fP, all in
uppercase, and the first letter following the \fBMPI_\fP prefix is also
uppercase. The rest of the letters in the routine are all lowercase, for
example, \fI\%MPI_Comm_get_attr\fP\&.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.sp
To fine\-tune your Open MPI environment, you can either use arguments
to the \fI\%mpirun\fP or \fI\%mpiexec\fP
commands, or you can use MCA parameters.
.sp
For more information on arguments, see the \fI\%mpirun(1)\fP man page.
.sp
For a complete listing of MCA parameters and their descriptions, issue
the command \fBompi_info \-\-all\fP\&.  See \fI\%ompi_info(1)\fP for more information.
.SH ERRORS
.sp
See \fI\%MPI Errors\fP for details about error values.
