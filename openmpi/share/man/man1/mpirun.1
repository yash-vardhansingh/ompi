\fBmpirun\fP and \fBmpiexec\fP are synonyms for each other.
Indeed, they are symbolic links to the same executable.
Using either of the names will produce the exact same
behavior.

Note that in both models, invoking \fBmpirun\fP via an absolute path
name is equivalent to specifying the \fB\-\-prefix\fP option with a
\fB<dir>\fP value equivalent to the directory where \fBmpirun\fP resides,
minus its last subdirectory.  For example:

.SH QUICK SUMMARY
.sp
If you are simply looking for how to run an MPI application, you
probably want to use a command line of the following form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell$ mpirun [ \-n X ] [ \-\-hostfile <filename> ]  <program>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will run \fBX\fP copies of \fB<program>\fP in your current run\-time
environment (if running under a supported resource manager, Open MPI’s
\fBmpirun\fP will usually automatically use the corresponding resource
manager process starter, as opposed to \fBssh\fP (for example), which
require the use of a hostfile, or will default to running all \fBX\fP
copies on the localhost), scheduling (by default) in a round\-robin
fashion by CPU slot.  See the rest of this documentation for more
details.
.sp
Please note that \fBmpirun\fP automatically binds processes to hardware
resources. Three binding patterns are used in the absence of any
further directives (See \fI\%map/rank/bind defaults\fP for more details):
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBind to core\fP:     when the number of processes is <= 2
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBind to package\fP:  when the number of processes is > 2
.IP \(bu 2
\fBBind to none\fP:     when oversubscribed
.UNINDENT
.sp
If your application uses threads, then you probably want to ensure
that you are either not bound at all (by specifying \fB\-\-bind\-to none\fP),
or bound to multiple cores using an appropriate binding level or
specific number of processing elements per application process.
.SH OPEN MPI’S USE OF PRRTE
.sp
Open MPI uses the PMIx Reference Runtime Environment (PRRTE) as the
main engine for launching, monitoring, and terminating MPI processes.
.sp
Much of the documentation below is directly imported from PRRTE.  As
such, it frequently refers to PRRTE concepts and command line options.
Except where noted, these concepts and command line argument are all
applicable to Open MPI as well.  Open MPI extends the available PRRTE
command line options, and also slightly modifies the PRRTE’s default
behaviors in a few cases.  These will be specifically described in the
docuemtnation below.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
.sp
The core of Open MPI’s \fBmpirun\fP processing is performed via the
\fI\%PRRTE\fP\&.  Specifically: \fBmpirun\fP is
effectively a wrapper around \fBprterun\fP, but \fBmpirun\fP’s CLI options
are slightly different than PRRTE’s CLI commands.
.SS No content
.sp
There is no meaningful content in this file because Open MPI was either:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Built without PRRTE support.
.IP \(bu 2
Built with a PRRTE that was too old to include machine\-readable
documentation that could be incorporated into Open MPI’s
documentation.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you build Open MPI with a newer version of PRRTE (and have the
Sphinx tool available when you run Open MPI’s \fBconfigure\fP command),
you should get more meaningful documentation here.
.sp
Hence, there is no documentation for this section.

.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-max\-vm\-size <size>\fP: Number of daemons to start.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Use one of the following options to specify which hosts (nodes) of the
cluster to run on. Note that as of the start of the v1.8 release,
mpirun will launch a daemon onto each host in the allocation (as
modified by the following options) at the very beginning of execution,
regardless of whether or not application processes will eventually be
mapped to execute there. This is done to allow collection of hardware
topology information from the remote nodes, thus allowing us to map
processes against known topology. However, it is a change from the
behavior in prior releases where daemons were only launched after
mapping was complete, and thus only occurred on nodes where
application processes would actually be executing.
.INDENT 0.0

logical CPUs on each node (comma\-separated list). Note that the
binding options will still apply within the specified envelope
— e.g., you can elect to bind each process to only one CPU
within the specified CPU set.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following options specify the number of processes to launch. Note
that none of the options imply a particular binding policy — e.g.,
requesting N processes for each package does not imply that the
processes will be bound to the package.

.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-n\fP, \fB\-c\fP, \fB\-np <#>\fP: Run this many copies of the

specified file is an executable program and not an application
context. If no value is provided for the number of copies to execute
(i.e., neither the \fB\-n\fP nor its synonyms are provided on the
command line), Open MPI will automatically execute a copy of the
program on each process slot (see PRRTE’s \fI\%defintion of “slot”\fP
for description of a “process slot”). This feature, however, can
only be used in the SPMD model and will return an error (without
beginning execution of the application) otherwise.

One invocation of \fBmpirun\fP starts an MPI application running under Open
MPI. If the application is single process multiple data (SPMD), the
application can be specified on the \fBmpirun\fP command line.
.sp
If the application is multiple instruction multiple data (MIMD),
comprising of multiple programs, the set of programs and argument can
be specified in one of two ways: Extended Command Line Arguments, and
Application Context.
.sp
An application context describes the MIMD program set including all
arguments in a separate file.  This file essentially contains multiple
mpirun command lines, less the command name itself.  The ability to
specify different options for different instantiations of a program is
another reason to use an application context.
.sp
Extended command line arguments allow for the description of the
application layout on the command line using colons (\fB:\fP) to
separate the specification of programs and arguments. Some options are
globally set across all specified programs (e.g., \fB\-\-hostfile\fP),
while others are specific to a single program (e.g., \fB\-n\fP).

is the same as \fB\-\-map\-by ppr:1:node\fP and \fB\-\-npernode 1\fP\&.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will launch processes 0\-3 on node \fBaa\fP and processes 4\-5 on node

the \fB\-n\fP option indicated that only 6 processes should be launched.

.sp
The \fB\-\-map\-by node\fP option will load balance the processes across the
available nodes, numbering each process in a round\-robin fashion.
.sp
The \fB\-\-nolocal\fP option prevents any processes from being mapped onto
the local host (in this case node \fBaa\fP).  While \fBmpirun\fP typically
consumes few system resources, \fB\-\-nolocal\fP can be helpful for
launching very large jobs where mpirun may actually need to use
noticeable amounts of memory and/or processing time.
.sp
Just as \fB\-n\fP can specify fewer processes than there are slots, it
can also oversubscribe the slots.  For example, with the same
hostfile:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell$ mpirun \-\-hostfile myhostfile \-n 14 ./a.out
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will launch processes 0\-3 on node \fBaa\fP, 4\-7 on \fBbb\fP, and 8\-11 on
\fBcc\fP\&.  It will then add the remaining two processes to whichever
nodes it chooses.
.sp
One can also specify limits to oversubscription.  For example, with the
same hostfile:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell$ mpirun \-\-hostfile myhostfile \-n 14 \-\-nooversubscribe ./a.out
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will produce an error since \fB\-\-nooversubscribe\fP prevents
oversubscription.
.sp
Limits to oversubscription can also be specified in the hostfile
itself:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell$ cat myhostfile
aa slots=4 max_slots=4
bb         max_slots=4
cc slots=4
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBmax_slots\fP field specifies such a limit.  When it does, the slots
value defaults to the limit.  Now:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell$ mpirun \-\-hostfile myhostfile \-n 14 ./a.out
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
causes the first 12 processes to be launched as before, but the
remaining two processes will be forced onto node \fBcc\fP\&.  The other
two nodes are protected by the hostfile against oversubscription by
this job.
.sp
Using the \fB\-\-nooversubscribe\fP option can be helpful since Open MPI
currently does not get \fBmax_slots\fP values from the resource manager.
.sp
Of course, \fB\-n\fP can also be used with the \fB\-H\fP or \fB\-host\fP
option.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell$ mpirun \-H aa,bb \-n 8 ./a.out
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
launches 8 processes.  Since only two hosts are specified, after the
first two processes are mapped, one to \fBaa\fP and one to \fBbb\fP, the
remaining processes oversubscribe the specified hosts.
.sp
And here is a MIMD example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell$ mpirun \-H aa \-n 1 hostname : \-H bb,cc \-n 2 uptime
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will launch process 0 running hostname on node \fBaa\fP and processes 1
and 2 each running uptime on nodes \fBbb\fP and \fBcc\fP, respectively.

Open MPI employs a three\-phase procedure for assigning process locations
and ranks:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
\fBMapping\fP: Assigns a default location to each process
.IP 2. 3
\fBRanking\fP: Assigns an MPI_COMM_WORLD rank value to each process
.IP 3. 3
\fBBinding\fP: Constrains each process to run on specific processors
.UNINDENT
.sp
The mapping step is used to assign a default location to each process
based on the mapper being employed. Mapping by slot, node, and
sequentially results in the assignment of the processes to the node
level. In contrast, mapping by object, allows the mapper to assign the
process to an actual object on each node.
.sp
Note that the location assigned to the process is independent of where
it will be bound — the assignment is used solely as input to the
binding algorithm.
.sp
The mapping of process processes to nodes can be defined not just with
general policies but also, if necessary, using arbitrary mappings that
cannot be described by a simple policy.  One can use the “sequential
mapper,” which reads the hostfile line by line, assigning processes to
nodes in whatever order the hostfile specifies.  Use the \fB\-\-\-map\-by seq\fP option.  For example, using the same hostfile as before:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell$ mpirun \-hostfile myhostfile \-\-map\-by seq ./a.out
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will launch three processes, one on each of nodes \fBaa\fP, \fBbb\fP, and \fBcc\fP,
respectively.  The slot counts don’t matter; one process is launched
per line on whatever node is listed on the line.
.sp
Another way to specify arbitrary mappings is with a rankfile, which
gives you detailed control over process binding as well.  Rankfiles
are discussed \fI\%below\fP\&.
.sp
The second phase focuses on the ranking of the process within the
job’s MPI_COMM_WORLD.  Open MPI separates this from the mapping
procedure to allow more flexibility in the relative placement of MPI
processes. This is best illustrated by considering the following
cases where we used the \fB\-\-np 8 \-\-map\-by ppr:2:package \-\-host aa:4,bb:4\fP option:
.TS

|l|l|l|.

.sp
Ranking by \fBfill\fP assigns MCW ranks in a simple progression across each
node. Ranking by \fBspan\fP and by \fBslot\fP provide the identical
result — a round\-robin progression of the packages across all nodes
before returning to the first package on the first node. Ranking by
\fBnode\fP assigns MCW ranks iterating first across nodes then by package.
.sp
The binding phase actually binds each process to a given set of
processors. This can improve performance if the operating system is
placing processes suboptimally.  For example, it might oversubscribe
some multi\-core processor packages, leaving other packages idle; this
can lead processes to contend unnecessarily for common resources.  Or,
it might spread processes out too widely; this can be suboptimal if
application performance is sensitive to interprocess communication
costs.  Binding can also keep the operating system from migrating
processes excessively, regardless of how optimally those processes
were placed to begin with.
.sp
The processors to be used for binding can be identified in terms of
topological groupings — e.g., binding to an \fBl3cache\fP will
bind each process to all processors within the scope of a single L3
cache within their assigned location. Thus, if a process is assigned
by the mapper to a certain package, then a \fB\-\-bind\-to l3cache\fP
directive will cause the process to be bound to the processors that
share a single L3 cache within that package.
.sp
Alternatively, processes can be mapped and bound to specified cores using
the \fB\-\-map\-by pe\-list=\fP option. For example, \fB\-\-map\-by pe\-list=0,2,5\fP
will map three processes all three of which will be bound to logical cores
\fB0,2,5\fP\&. If you intend to bind each of the three processes to different
cores then the \fB:ordered\fP qualifier can be used like
\fB\-\-map\-by pe\-list=0,2,5:ordered\fP\&. In this example, the first process
on a node will be bound to CPU 0, the second process on the node will
be bound to CPU 2, and the third process on the node will be bound to
CPU 5.
.sp
Finally, \fB\-\-report\-bindings\fP can be used to report bindings.
.sp
As an example, consider a node with two processor packages, each
comprised of four cores, and each of those cores contains one hardware
thread.  The \fB\-\-report\-bindings\fP option shows the binding of each process in a
descriptive manner. Below are some examples.

In the above case, the output shows us that 2 cores have been bound per
process.  Specifically, the mapping by \fBslot\fP with the \fBPE=2\fP qualifier
indicated that each slot (i.e., process) should consume two processor
elements.  By default, Open MPI defines “processor element” as “core”,
and therefore the \fB\-\-bind\-to core\fP caused each process to be bound to
both of the cores to which it was mapped.

Open MPI’s support for process binding depends on the underlying

be available on every system.
.sp
Process binding can also be set with MCA parameters.  Their usage is
less convenient than that of \fBmpirun\fP options.  On the other hand,
MCA parameters can be set not only on the mpirun command line, but
alternatively in a system or user \fBmca\-params.conf\fP file or as
environment variables, as described in the \fI\%Setting MCA
Parameters\fP\&. These are MCA parameters for
the PRRTE runtime so the command line argument \fB\-\-PRRTEmca\fP must be used to

The mapping pattern might be better seen if we change the default \fB\-\-rank\-by\fP from \fBfill\fP to \fBspan\fP\&. First, the processes are mapped by package iterating between the two marking a core at a time. Next, the processes are ranked in a spanning manner that load balances them across the object they were mapped against. Finally, the processes are bound to the core that they were mapped againast.

Rankfiles are text files that specify detailed information about how
individual processes should be mapped to nodes, and to which
processor(s) they should be bound.  Each line of a rankfile specifies
the location of one process (for MPI jobs, the process’ “rank” refers
to its rank in MPI_COMM_WORLD).  The general form of each line in the
rankfile is:

Note that only logicical processor locations are supported. By default, the values specifed are assumed to be cores.

.sp
If the binding specification overlaps between any two ranks then an error occurs. If you intend to allow processes to share the same logical processing unit then you must pass the \fB\-\-bind\-to :overload\-allowed\fP command line option to tell the runtime to ignore this check.
.sp
The hostnames listed above are “absolute,” meaning that actual
resolveable hostnames are specified.  However, hostnames can also be
specified as “relative,” meaning that they are specified in relation
to an externally\-specified list of hostnames (e.g., by \fBmpirun\fP’s
\fB\-\-host\fP argument, a hostfile, or a job scheduler).
.sp
The “relative” specification is of the form \fB+n<X>\fP, where X is an
integer specifying the Xth hostname in the set of all available

If a relative directory is specified, it must be relative to the

The \fB\-\-wdir\fP \fBmpirun\fP option (and its synonym, \fB\-\-wd\fP) allows
the user to change to an arbitrary directory before the program is
invoked.  It can also be used in application context files to specify
working directories on specific nodes and/or for specific
applications.
.sp
If the \fB\-\-wdir\fP option appears both in a context file and on the
command line, the context file directory will override the command
line value.
.sp
If the \fB\-wdir\fP option is specified, Open MPI will attempt to change
to the specified directory on all of the remote nodes. If this fails,
\fBmpirun\fP will abort.
.sp
If the \fB\-wdir\fP option is not specified, Open MPI will send the
directory name where \fBmpirun\fP was invoked to each of the remote
nodes.  The remote nodes will try to change to that directory.  If
they are unable (e.g., if the directory does not exist on that node),
then Open MPI will use the default directory determined by the
starter.

All directory changing occurs before the user’s program is invoked; it
does not wait until \fI\%MPI_INIT(3)\fP is called.

Open MPI directs UNIX standard output and error from remote nodes to
the node that invoked \fBmpirun\fP and prints it on the standard

output/error of \fBmpirun\fP and transfer to it directly.
.sp
Thus it is possible to redirect standard I/O for Open MPI applications
by using the typical shell redirection procedure on \fBmpirun\fP\&.  For
example:

During the run of an MPI application, if any process dies abnormally
(either exiting before invoking \fI\%MPI_FINALIZE(3)\fP,
or dying as the result of a signal), \fBmpirun\fP will print out an
error message and kill the rest of the MPI application.
.sp
User signal handlers should probably avoid trying to cleanup MPI state
(Open MPI is currently not async\-signal\-safe; see
\fI\%MPI_INIT_THREAD(3)\fP for details about
MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE and thread safety).  For example, if a
segmentation fault occurs in \fI\%MPI_SEND(3)\fP (perhaps
because a bad buffer was passed in) and a user signal handler is
invoked, if this user handler attempts to invoke \fI\%MPI_FINALIZE(3)\fP, Bad Things could happen since Open MPI was already
“in” MPI when the error occurred.  Since \fBmpirun\fP will notice that the
process died due to a signal, it is probably not necessary (and
safest) for the user to only clean up non\-MPI state.

Processes in the MPI application inherit their environment from the
PRRTE daemon upon the node on which they are running.  The
environment is typically inherited from the user’s shell.  On remote
nodes, the exact environment is determined by the boot MCA module
used.  The rsh launch module, for example, uses either rsh/ssh to
launch the PRRTE daemon on remote nodes, and typically executes one
or more of the user’s shell\-setup files before launching the PRRTE
daemon.  When running dynamically linked applications which require
the \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fP environment variable to be set, care must be
taken to ensure that it is correctly set when booting Open MPI.

Open MPI requires that the \fBPATH\fP environment variable be set to
find executables on remote nodes (this is typically only necessary in
rsh\- or ssh\-based environments — batch/scheduled environments
typically copy the current environment to the execution of remote
jobs, so if the current environment has \fBPATH\fP and/or
\fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fP set properly, the remote nodes will also have it
set properly).  If Open MPI was compiled with shared library support,
it may also be necessary to have the \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fP environment
variable set on remote nodes as well (especially to find the shared
libraries required to run user MPI applications).
.sp
However, it is not always desirable or possible to edit shell startup
files to set \fBPATH\fP and/or \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fP\&.  The \fB\-\-prefix\fP
option is provided for some simple configurations where this is not
possible.
.sp
The \fB\-\-prefix\fP option takes a single argument: the base directory on
the remote node where Open MPI is installed.  Open MPI will use this
directory to set the remote \fBPATH\fP and \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fP before
executing any Open MPI or user applications.  This allows running Open
MPI jobs without having pre\-configured the \fBPATH\fP and
\fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fP on the remote nodes.
.sp
Open MPI adds the basename of the current node’s \fB$bindir\fP (the
directory where Open MPI’s executables were installed) to the prefix
and uses that to set the \fBPATH\fP on the remote node.  Similarly, Open
MPI adds the basename of the current node’s \fB$libdir\fP (the directory
where Open MPI’s libraries were installed) to the prefix and uses that
to set the \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fP on the remote node.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0

.UNINDENT

Open MPI will add \fB/remote/node/directory/bin\fP to the \fBPATH\fP and
\fB/remote/node/directory/lib64\fP to the \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fP on the
remote node before attempting to execute anything.
.sp
The \fB\-\-prefix\fP option is not sufficient if the installation paths on
the remote node are different than the local node (e.g., if \fB/lib\fP
is used on the local node, but \fB/lib64\fP is used on the remote node),
or if the installation paths are something other than a subdirectory
under a common prefix.
.sp
Note that executing \fBmpirun\fP via an absolute pathname is equivalent
to specifying \fB\-\-prefix\fP without the last subdirectory in the
absolute pathname to \fBmpirun\fP\&.  For example:

option to mpirun has been deprecated, but the syntax of the MCA param
follows that prior example. While the syntax of the \fB\-x\fP option and
MCA param allows the definition of new variables, note that the parser
for these options are currently not very sophisticated — it does
not even understand quoted values.  Users are advised to set variables
in the environment and use the option to export them; not to define

The \fB\-\-mca\fP switch allows the passing of parameters to various MCA
(Modular Component Architecture) modules.  MCA modules have direct
impact on MPI programs because they allow tunable parameters to be set
at run time (such as which BTL communication device driver to use,
what parameters to pass to that BTL, etc.).
.sp
The \fB\-\-mca\fP switch takes two arguments: \fB<key>\fP and \fB<value>\fP\&.
The \fB<key>\fP argument generally specifies which MCA module will
receive the value.  For example, the \fB<key>\fP \fBbtl\fP is used to
select which BTL to be used for transporting MPI messages.  The
\fB<value>\fP argument is the value that is passed.  For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell$ mpirun \-\-mca btl tcp,self \-n 1 my_mpi_app
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This tells Open MPI to use the \fBtcp\fP and \fBself\fP BTLs, and to run a
single copy of \fBmy_mpi_app\fP an allocated node.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Tells Open MPI to use the \fBself\fP BTL, and to run a single copy of
\fBmy_mpi_app\fP an allocated node.
.sp
The \fB\-\-mca\fP switch can be used multiple times to specify different
<key> and/or \fB<value>\fP arguments.  If the same \fB<key>\fP is
specified more than once, the \fB<value>\(ga\(gas are concatenated with a
comma (\fP,\(ga\(ga) separating them.
.sp
Note that the \fB\-\-mca\fP switch is simply a shortcut for setting
environment variables.  The same effect may be accomplished by setting
corresponding environment variables before running \fBmpirun\fP\&.  The form
of the environment variables that Open MPI sets is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
OMPI_MCA_<key>=<value>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Thus, the \fB\-\-mca\fP switch overrides any previously set environment
variables.  The \fB\-\-mca\fP settings similarly override MCA parameters
set in the \fB$OPAL_PREFIX/etc/openmpi\-mca\-params.conf\fP or
\fB$HOME/.openmpi/mca\-params.conf\fP file.
.sp
Unknown \fB<key>\fP arguments are still set as environment variable —
they are not checked (by mpirun) for correctness.  Illegal or
incorrect \fB<value>\fP arguments may or may not be reported — it
depends on the specific MCA module.
.sp
To find the available component types under the MCA architecture, or
to find the available parameters for a specific component, use the

\fBWARNING:\fP

The Open MPI team \fBstrongly\fP advises against executing
\fBmpirun\fP as the root user.  MPI applications should be
run as regular (non\-root) users.

.sp
\fBmpirun\fP will refuse to run as root by default.
.sp
To override this default, you can add the \fB\-\-allow\-run\-as\-root\fP
option to the mpirun command line, or you can set the environmental
parameters \fBOMPI_ALLOW_RUN_AS_ROOT=1\fP and
\fBOMPI_ALLOW_RUN_AS_ROOT_CONFIRM=1\fP\&.  Note that it takes setting two
environment variables to effect the same behavior as
\fB\-\-allow\-run\-as\-root\fP in order to stress the Open MPI team’s strong
advice against running as the root user.
.sp
After extended discussions with communities who use containers (where
running as the root user is the default), there was a persistent
desire to be able to enable root execution of \fBmpirun\fP via an
environmental control (vs. the existing \fB\-\-allow\-run\-as\-root\fP
command line parameter).  The compromise of using two environment
variables was reached: it allows root execution via an environmental
control, but it conveys the Open MPI team’s strong recommendation
against this behavior.

There is no standard definition for what \fBmpirun\fP should return as
an exit status. After considerable discussion, we settled on the
following method for assigning the \fBmpirun\fP exit status (note: in
the following description, the “primary” job is the initial
application started by mpirun — all jobs that are spawned by
that job are designated “secondary” jobs):
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If all processes in the primary job normally terminate with exit
status 0, \fBmpirun\fP returns 0.
.IP \(bu 2
If one or more processes in the primary job normally terminate with
non\-zero exit status, \fBmpirun\fP returns the exit status of the
process with the lowest MPI_COMM_WORLD rank to have a non\-zero
status.
.IP \(bu 2
If all processes in the primary job normally terminate with exit
status 0, and one or more processes in a secondary job normally
terminate with non\-zero exit status, \fBmpirun\fP:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP 1. 3
Returns the exit status of the process with the lowest
MPI_COMM_WORLD rank in the lowest jobid to have a non\-zero
status, and
.IP 2. 3
Outputs a message summarizing the exit status of the primary and
all secondary jobs.
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
If the command line option \fB\-\-report\-child\-jobs\-separately\fP is
set, we will return \fIonly\fP the exit status of the primary job. Any
non\-zero exit status in secondary jobs will be reported solely in a
summary print statement.
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, the job will abort when any process terminates with
non\-zero status. The MCA parameter \fB\-\-PRRTEmca state_base_error_non_zero_exit\fP
can be set to “false” (or “0”) to cause Open MPI to not abort a job if
one or more processes return a non\-zero status. In that situation the
Open MPI records and notes that processes exited with non\-zero
termination status to report the appropriate exit status of \fBmpirun\fP (per
bullet points above).

\fBmpirun\fP returns 0 if all processes started by mpirun exit after
calling \fI\%MPI_FINALIZE(3)\fP\&.  A non\-zero value is
returned if an internal error occurred in mpirun, or one or more
processes exited before calling \fI\%MPI_FINALIZE(3)\fP\&.
If an internal error occurred in mpirun, the corresponding error code
is returned.  In the event that one or more processes exit before
calling \fI\%MPI_FINALIZE(3)\fP, the return value of
the MPI_COMM_WORLD rank of the process that mpirun first notices died
before calling \fI\%MPI_FINALIZE(3)\fP will be
returned.  Note that, in general, this will be the first process that
died but is not guaranteed to be so.
.sp
If the \fB\-\-timeout\fP command line option is used and the timeout
expires before the job completes (thereby forcing mpirun to kill the
job) mpirun will return an exit status equivalent to the value of
ETIMEDOUT (which is typically 110 on Linux and OS X systems).
